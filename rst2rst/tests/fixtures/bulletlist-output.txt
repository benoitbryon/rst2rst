Bullet lists
############

In reStructuredText specification, there is no strict convention about bullet
lists.


*****************
Bullet characters
*****************

You can use any allowed characters as first-level bullets.

Asterisks are recognized as bullets:

* first item.
* second item.

Minus sign is also recognized as bullets:

* first item.
* second item.

This applies to nested lists too.

* asterisk as first level.

  * minus as second level.

... means the same as:

* minus as first level.

  * asterisk as second level.


***********
Indentation
***********

reStructuredText specification permits various indentation.

* 1 space between bullet and text is valid.

And,

* 2 spaces between bullet and text is valid too.

And,

* 3 spaces between bullet and text is valid too. The more spaces, the less
  readable.

And,

* bullets indented with an exotic number of spaces (as an example, 42 spaces)
  is still valid!

As a result,

* You can have 1st level content

  * Where text is left aligned with content of 2nd level blocks

    * or

      * more... It doesn't improve document's readability.


*******
Spacing
*******

You can use an arbitrary number of empty lines between each list item.

* Zero empty lines,
* One empty line,
* Two empty lines,
* Or more,
* ... the bullet list is valid.

Moreover,

* when several list items span over multiple lines, it becomes quite difficult
  to visually identify the paragraphs if there is no space, or no consistent
  spacing. In order to illustrate this, let's generate some long sentences...

* One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen one
  fourteen two fifteen three sixteen four seventeen five eighteen six nineteen
  seven twenty one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
  thirteen one fourteen two fifteen three sixteen four seventeen five eighteen.

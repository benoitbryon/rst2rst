Bullet lists
############

In reStructuredText specification, there is no strict convention about bullet
lists.


*****************
Bullet characters
*****************

You can use any allowed characters as first-level bullets.

Asterisks are recognized as bullets:

* first item.
* second item.

Minus sign is also recognized as bullets:

* first item.
* second item.

This applies to nested lists too.

* asterisk as first level.

  * minus as second level.

... means the same as:

* minus as first level.

  * asterisk as second level.


***********
Indentation
***********

reStructuredText specification permits various indentation.

* 1 space between bullet and text is valid.

And,

* 2 spaces between bullet and text is valid too.

And,

* 3 spaces between bullet and text is valid too. The more spaces, the less
  readable.

And,

* bullets indented with an exotic number of spaces (as an example, 42 spaces)
  is still valid!

As a result,

* You can have 1st level content

  * Where text is left aligned with content of 2nd level blocks

    * or

      * more... It doesn't improve document's readability.


*******
Spacing
*******

You can use an arbitrary number of empty lines between each list item.

* Zero empty lines,
* One empty line,
* Two empty lines,
* Or more,
* ... the bullet list is valid.

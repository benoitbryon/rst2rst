Test for sections (level 1)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

One problem with titles in reStructuredText specification is that there is no
conventions for titles. In this test, we set titles using custom symbols,
overlines, spacing and overline/underline length. It makes the document
difficult to read. Moreover, you must read the beginning of the document in
order to understand the meaning of overlines/underlines somewhere in the
document, i.e. you can't guess the heading level without knowing its parents.

rst2rst makes it possible to standardize titles.

Isn't the test output easier to read?

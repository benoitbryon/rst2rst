In
reStructuredText
specification, there is no
convention about text wrapping
so you can write
small
lines
and nothing prevents you to write extremely long lines like the following:

lorem ipsum dolor sit amet and some text randomly generated whatever it doesn't matters. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve.

rst2rst provides text wrapping.

Default line length is ................ exactly ................ 79 characters.

  And indented text is wrapped to exactly 79 characters too. This is a test... Wrapping should just begin on the W.

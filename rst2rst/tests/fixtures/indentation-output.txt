In reStructuredText specification, there is no strict convention about
indentation.

  Indentation with 2 spaces is valid.

    A block indented with 4 spaces right after one indented with 2 spaces is a
    nested (2nd level) indent.

But,

  A block indented with 4 spaces right after a "root" text block is a 1st level
  indent.

And,

  Even some exotic indentation with 42 spaces can be 1st level indentation.

And,

  Both tabs and spaces are allowed for indentation.

And,

  You can even mix spaces and tabs in a block!

It makes the document harder to read. You can't guess the meaning of some block
by just looking at it's own indentation: you have to look at the indentation of
the context (i.e. its parents).

rst2rst makes it possible to standardize indentation: in a given situation,
always use the same indentation rules.

As an example, by default (i.e. as a convention) every blockquote is indented
with 2 spaces. So a blockquote with 4 spaces is a 2nd level indent.

In reStructuredText specification, there is no convention about indentation.

  It means indentation with 2 spaces is valid.

    A block indented with 4 spaces right after one indented with 2 spaces is a
    nested (2nd level) indent.

But,

  A block indented with 4 spaces right after a "root" text block is a 1st level
  indent.

And,

  Even some exotic indentation is valid.

It makes the document harder to read.

rst2rst makes it possible to standardize indentation: in a given situation,
always use the same indentation rules.
